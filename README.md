# A Tensorflow Project
## A Tensorflow project has this typical workflow:
### Collecting Data
### Creating a Model
### Adding Layers to the Model
### Compiling the Model
### Training the Model
### Using the Model

## Example
Suppose you knew a function that defined a strait line:

### Y = 1.2X + 5

Then you could calculate any y value with the JavaScript formula:

### y = 1.2 * x + 5;

To demonstrate Tensorflow.js, we could train a Tensorflow.js model to predict Y values based on X inputs.

The TensorFlow model does not know the function.
